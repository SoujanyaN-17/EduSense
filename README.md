# EduSense
This project is an AI-powered learning ecosystem frontend that dynamically adapts educational content based on real-time user behavior analysis. The system uses the device's webcam (with user permission) to detect and analyze facial expressions (emotions) and eye movements (attention tracking) using browser-based AI models like face-api.js and webgazer.js. The frontend is built to deliver a personalized learning experience, adjusting content based on the learner's mood, focus level, and historical learning patterns. It includes an interactive UI with components such as a live video feed, real-time emotion detection overlay, and attention graphs. The frontend also communicates with backend services (if integrated) to log behavior data, enabling adaptive learning strategies. This system is particularly suited for e-learning platforms, aiming to enhance engagement, retention, and user satisfaction through smart, responsive interfaces powered by computer vision and behavioral analyticsâ€”all running client-side for speed and privacy.
